And <em>kaama </em>is 'desire' the natural basic instinct of any animal, and the one which the sages and saints want to overcome, so they named Love-god from their point of view. In these verses the two words <em>kR^ita udvaaham </em>, and their meaning as on marrying Parvati and going this way with his coterie etc., is held incongruous to other mythological episodes of Shiva's marriage with Parvati, and Manmatha's effort to enkindle love in Shiva. After marriage with Parvati, some argue, where is the question of Love-god's interference to inculcate love in Shiva. It is clear in Rama Charita Maanas how this Shiva-Parvati marriage occurs. And some give the meaning like this: <em>kR^ita </em>where <em>kR^i= karaNe udvaaham tu devesham </em>= to actualise, marriage, only, of Shiva; <em>gacChantam </em>on going there, Love-god, <em>sa marudgaNam </em>with Wind-gods and other deities; <em>dharSayaamaasa </em>started to attack Shiva.
