    "overview": "Legend of Shiva's bow is narrated as Vishvamitra asks Janaka to show that bow to Rama and Lakshmana, as they have come this far to have a glimpse of that great bow. Janaka, while narrating its history, makes an offer saying that his daughter Sita will be given in marriage, if only Rama can string the bowstring of Shiva's bow. In the very same sixty-sixth chapter of Kishkindha Kanda, Valmiki narrates the birth of Hanuman through Jambavanta, elaborately. But here Valmiki informs through Janaka about the nature of birth of Sita, very concisely, which gave raise to too much of debate about this enigmatic Sita and her birth. Some points are given in the endnote.",

And this dowry or its counterpart is not compulsorily be paid in hard cash, but it may be any kind of gifts mutually exchanged, which has slowly developed into a mega havoc these days.

Once, when Sita was playing with other girls, their flowery ball of girl's rugby goes under this cart. None of her girlfriends is dare enough to near this bow-casket-cart, since it is a reverential casket-cart. But Sita goes there and pushes that casket-cart aside with her left hand, as though it is a garland, and retrieves that flower ball. This capability of Sita in easy handling of Shiva's bow, becomes a bane to her, when one among the wives of <em>sapta R^iSi </em>'Seven Sages...' issues a curse to Sita, saying that 'Sita will be separated from her husband for some time, of course, for the good of people...'

It would be better to check and recheck their source material for this statement, if it were to be Valmiki Ramayana, on reading the verses 13, 14 and the last one of this chapter, where it is said that the birth of Sita is a<font color=\"#B3003A\">non-uterine birth</font>, as there is neither a Menaka, nor a woman, nor any semen."

With these, a created living being is created. This is in the case of mortals and their births. But when Sita is found in the furrow all these things have already happened and there is no question of human pregnancy to be attached to her. Hence Sita is to be taken as Goddess Lakshmi, who is <font color=\"#B3003A\">paraa shakti, Vishnu Maya</font> and when she has to take an incarnation to become the prime cause to the effect of eliminating Ravana, no human activity of reproduction can be attached to such beings. If she were to be a human, perhaps she would not have exited from the pyre of fire when she self-immolated, after Rama and Ravana war.

Thus this Shakti of god is personified in mythological lore and is called Shri or Lakshmi, and She is said to manifest herself in, 1] <font color=\"#B3003A\">kriyaa shakti</font>, Creative Activity and 2] <font color=\"#B3003A\">bhuuti shakti</font>, Creation of God.

He therefore needs His consort Goddess Lakshmi to be with Him always, untouched by any. Thus, Goddess Lakshmi has to accompany Vishnu in all His incarnations, along with other paraphernalia like his conch-shell, his quoit and mace, and the thousand headed serpent <font color=\"#B3003A\">aadi sheSa</font> etc. Such a delightful deity Goddess Lakshmi is a treasure house that can be abducted by the greedy, but she is fickle like ripples <em>lakShmii hi toya taranga capalaa</em> Lakshmi= Goddess Lakshmi; hi= indeed; toya= water; taranga= wave like; capalaa= wavering. 'Goddess Lakshmi is wavering like the waves of water...' <font color=\"#B3003A\">chapala, chanchala, asthira</font>, wavering, faltering, unstable, and <font color=\"#B3003A\">maayaa, maa + yaa</font> 'whose illusory play she is, or <font color=\"#B3003A\">liila</font> play of god. She comes in unnoticeably like the water in a coconut and evaporates innocently into thin air, at Her will. Such as she is she is easily grabbed by the greedy. Hence none can give birth to her except the Mother Nature, and hence she is called <font color=\"#B3003A\">mahilaa ; mahi + laa</font> where<font color=\"#B3003A\">mahi</font> is earth and <font color=\"#B3003A\">laa ; laH khaNDane triSu aadaane stri</font> because Mother Earth gave birth to Sita, Sita is<font color=\"#B3003A\">mahila</font> Hence it is better to avoid assuming her to be an ordinary lady of an ordinary birth, and she may be viewed either legendarily or mythologically, for Valmiki as an epical poet, himself has not chronicled the details of her birth."

As such, the reason for Sita to be there in that furrow as baby is said to be a vow of Goddess Lakshmi, in her earlier incarnation as Vedavati. The mythologies go on to say that Vedavati is the brainchild of a sage called Kushadhwaja, and he decides to give Vedavati in marriage none less than Vishnu. But in his lifetime, it is an unfulfilled desire. Then Vedavati starts a rigorous penance to achieve her father's wish. When she is at her culmination point of her penance, Ravana, passing that way in sky sees this beautiful lady, nears, and disturbs her penance. Vedavati coming out of her meditation, curses Ravana saying that she will reincarnate herself, to destroy Ravana and his entire dynasty. Then she causes a yogic fire and immolates herself in it. And Vedavati is reborn as Sita of Ramayana, in an unusual way."

            "text": "Here <font color=\"#B3003A\">aananda raamaayaNa</font> has an interesting parable. Once there was a king named Padmaaksha who wanted Lakshmi as his daughter. On practising ascesis Vishnu appears and gives a fruit called <font color=\"#B3003A\">maatulunga phala</font>, and girl emerges from out of that fruit, and she is named as<font color=\"#B3003A\">Padma</font>. But greedy to possess her, all the wooing kings war with Padmaaksha and his entire family is ruined and Padma jumps into fire and self immolates herself. Later when Vishnu's <font color=\"#B3003A\">maaya</font> comes out of an altar of fire, sits in her meditation, Ravana sees her and wants to abduct her. Of course, she is otherwise said to be Vedavati in other texts. But again, she enters the fire altar and reduces herself to ashes. Even then, Ravana searches in those ashes for her. In there, he gets five diamonds of high quality. He comes to Lanka and paces those diamonds in a casket and jovially presents them to his wife Mandodari. When Mandodari could not lift the casket Ravana lifts it and opens its lid, as he lifted Mt. Kailash. When the casket is opened, Mandodari finds a baby girl in it and recognises her to be Goddess Lakshmi. Then they consult their teachers about that baby's arrival. Those teaches wishing good for Ravana, advise to get rid off this girl immediately, for he is Goddess Lakshmi, arrived here only to end Ravana and his dynasty. Then Mandodari orders his servants to carry away this baby in a casket by an aircraft and get rid off it."

            "text": "But Ravana rushes after the girl with a sword, to put that girl to sword. Empress Mandodari pacifies Ravana and says \"Why purchase a later time death now itself at the hand of this baby... let that the casket be buried...\" Ravana agrees. Mandodari also curses this girl saying, <font color=\"#B3003A\">\"this faithless girl, [for wealth is unfaithful,] will thrive only in a house, where the householder has his senses conquered, and who being an emperor lives like a perfect hermit, and who though wealthy and supreme by himself, will care nothing for the riches but view whole of the world and people as his own soul, with an impartial attitude...\"</font> Thus this casket is buried in the fields of King Janaka's empire by demons, clandestinely. Mandodari thought that such a person is an impossibility to take birth in this mortal world, to foster this buried girl, and thus presumed her curse to be twisty. But there is King Janaka with all the above attributes. A king without ego, wealthy but living simple, childless, yet does not crave for one, like King Dasharatha. Hence, he is called <font color=\"#B3003A\">raajarSi</font> a saintly king. Sita's birth is to be limitedly understood, as said by Janaka in this chapter. Otherwise, the nuances about the birth of Sita are to be viewed through the viewfinders of mythologies, legends, and above all, through the viewfinders of tradition... but not in the vast of epical poetry, as Valmiki himself has undocumented it..."
