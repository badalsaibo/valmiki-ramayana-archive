    "chapter": "19",
    "overview": "Sage Vishvamitra asks King Dasharatha to send Rama to protect the Vedic ritual that is being conducted by him, from the demons that are constantly disrupting it. The sage asserts King Dasharatha that he and the other sages in Dasharatha's court know the capabilities of Rama and though Rama is in his adolescence, he can easily kill the demons. But Dasharatha is upset at this request.",

What concerns I have in my heart I am going to say, and you take decision thereof, oh, tigerly-king, and become truthful to your promises. These days I am abiding by a sacrificial vow to attain a spiritual goal but, oh, best one among men, two guise changing demons as causing obstacles to that ritual. At the near end of almost completed ritual of mine two valiant and well-trained demons, namely Mareecha and Subaahu, are drenching the Altar of Fire with streams of meat and blood, from the sky. When the ritual vow is thus ravaged I, as the one who exerted myself for the ritual, had to depart from that place, unenthusiastically. And to me there is no will to let loose my anger, oh, king, as no curse shall be issued under vows, and like that the activity during rituals shall be inoffensive, isn't it."

Indeed, he is capable to eradicate those demons that are thwarting the ritual by his own divine resplendence, and protected by me as well. I will also accord many kinds of benefits to him by which he acquires renown in all the three worlds, no doubt about it."

            "text": "Please refer to verse section for wording. These verses are commented extensively by early commentators. In 14th verse, the pronoun <em>aham</em>, 'I' used by Sage Vishvamitra is to announce definiteness about his own stature to know the Absolute vis-Ã -vis the Absolute Himself. Vishvamitra was an emperor who left off everything. He was primarily a <em>raaja R^ishi</em>, kingly sage, later became <em>Brahma R^ishi </em>and performed <em>moksha kaameSTi</em>. That is a highest ascesis for achieving salvation. Whereas Dasharatha performed Vedic ritual called <em>putra kaameSTi</em>, ritual for begetting sons, as he is still involved in earthly passions. Thus he is still in karmic cycle and recently went under the veil of <em>moha</em>, worldly delusion, advent to the birth of sons. So Dasharatha cannot know who Rama is. All these aspects are said to qualify that expression<em>aham</em>, i.e., 'I am', as said by Vishvamitra."

Rama is at present a twelve-year lad, and Dasharatha should have enquired how a boy is said to be a sublime-soul. Dasharatha did not bother to enquire about the high souled property of his son, because of his newfound fondness for sons. But, Vishvamitra is in full knowledge as to who Rama is, and says Rama is a sublime-soul, as contained in scripture <em>puruSa suukta </em>which says <em>veda aham etam puruSam mahaantam</em>, and as in <em>yo maam pashyati.me na praNasyati </em>Bhagavad Gita, 6-30, as well."

He says, <em>vashiSTHo api </em>even Sage Vashishta, knows Rama. Here the word <em>api </em>, even, is said to have been used to qualify Vashishta as an antagonist of Vishvamitra in policy differences. 'Even my opponent, this Sage Vashishta, the descendent of Goddess Saraswati and Brahma, and a <em>BrahmarSi</em>, Absolute-knower, and at whose instance I became a <em>BrahmarSi </em>from <em>aajarSi</em>, is aware of Rama...' is the argument of Vishvamitra, stressing his neutrality in seeking Rama's help."

Vishvamitra's argument is 'Sage Vashishta may take sides with you, because he is <em>raja guru </em>, the royal priest, while the others like Kaashyapa, Vaamadeva will tell you clearly, as they have no leaning on your court.'"
