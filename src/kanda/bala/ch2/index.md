## Verses

On hearing that discourse from Sage Narada that contained , or Ramayana in a nutshell, narrated in the previous chapter, that great sage of virtuous mind and an expert sentence maker Valmiki, revered the Divine Sage Narada, along with his disciples. That divine sage Narada having been worshipped in that way by Valmiki in a befitting way, and on seeking permission of Valmiki to leave, and having been permitted by Valmiki went away heavenward.

A while after the departure of Narada to heavens, that sage Valmiki proceeded to the riverbanks of Tamasa, which are not far off form River Jahnavai i.e., River Ganga. Then Valmiki drew nigh of River Tamasa's riverbanks, and on beholding an un filthy strand of that river, he spoke to his disciple available at his side.

"Oh! Bharadwaja, un filthy is this watery foreshore, and with pleasant waters it is heart pleasing... like a noble man's heart... behold it... keep that handy vessel there, oh, Bharadwaja, and give me my loincloth... I will enter only this best ford of Tamasa River..." Thus Valmiki said to Bharadwaja.

When Bharadwaaja is said in that way by great souled Valmiki, himself being a humble disciple of his mentor, he gave that jute cloth to that saint, that humbly. That self controlled Sage Valmiki on taking loincloth from the hands of his disciple, indeed ambled towards the river, looking everywhere at the wide of the forest.

There the godly sage Valmiki saw a couple of lovely krouncha birds, in the vicinity of that river's foreshore, flying there about in togetherness, and of course, fearless of any calamity, and calling charmingly.

A tribal hunter with all his evil intent, as he is an enemy of foresters, killed the male one of the couple of birds, while Valmiki is looking on.

She who is ever together with her husband, a lusty male bird with flighty wings and with a prideful red crest, and one who always had a heart for her, but she is now separated from him, and gone is that togetherness; and she, on seeing her slain husband whose body is blood soaked, and who is reeling on the ground in the anguish of pain, bewailed with piteous utterances.

On seeing at that bird felled that way by the tribal hunter, compassion is aroused in that kind hearted sage Valmiki. Then on seeing the wailing female krounchi bird, and compassion haunting him and apperceiving the killing of male bird as unjust, the sage uttered this sentence.

"Oh! Ill fated hunter, by which reason you have killed one male bird of the bird couple, when it is in its lustful passion, thereby, may you get ignominy till the end of your lifespan..."

On saying thus, and pondering for a while in his heart, 'annoyed by the anguish for that bird, what is it uttered by me...' thus he became cogitative of those lines he uttered. On thinking, he that eminently astute and intellectual sage Valmiki made up his mind, and he that erudite scholar also spoke this sentence to his disciples.

"This utterance of mine has emerged from me who am annoyed in anguish, and this utterance is well arranged with letters metrically posited, tuneful and rhythmical to be sung with string instrument, and hence, this shall be a verse, not otherwise..."

Even the disciple happily received what that is articulated by the saint, a unique articulation, by which that saint Valmiki too is satisfied and became very happy. Then that saint on performing his bathing in that ford according to custom, and still thinking on the purport of his utterance, he returned towards his hermitage.

Then Bharadwaja, the obedient disciple and an erudite scholar, for he heard and learnt many scriptures by listening, took the handy vessel of his mentor, filled fully with water, and followed at the behind of his mentor. He that knower of dharma, Valmiki, having entered the threshold of his hermitage along with disciples, and having seated spoke about the day to day teachings and also other things, but he himself is preoccupied in cogitation on the verse. Then, the great resplendent Four faced creator of fourteen worlds, almighty Brahma, arrived there on his own, to see that eminent saint Valmiki.

Then on seeing Brahma that pious saint Valmiki is highly surprised, and on quickly getting up from his seat with his palms adjoined humbly, he stood aside, as he is spellbind. Valmiki venerated Brahma, on inquiring into his well being, washed his feet, drenched his thirst, seated him to rest, and adored at best with customarily obeisance.

While sitting on a seat which is highly worshipped by Valmiki, god Brahma then beckoned at Valmiki to take befitting seat. Even though Valmiki sat on his seat when duly permitted by Brahma, and though the Grandparent of the worlds is manifestly sitting before him, but the same broodings of the happenings of that day, recurred in his mind.

"That tribal hunter killed that cutely calling krounch bird for no good reason than intending to capture the kill, thus that evil souled one caused hardship..." thus Valmiki brooded on. Remaining in melancholic mood Valmiki turned his mind to the depth of thinking, and again thinking only on the krouncha bird he sung the same verse, involuntarily.

Then, Brahma smilingly spoke to that eminent saint Valmiki, "But, what that is composed is a verse only... and there is no need to think through...

"Oh, Brahman, that speech of yours sprang forth at my wish alone, hence oh, eminent sage, you shall render the legend of Rama, in its entirety... you shall narrate the legend of Rama, the virtuous, intellectual and an intrepid one, and a godlike person in this world as well, as has been heard from sage Narada.

"The adventures of valorous Rama along with Lakshmana, and the misadventures of demons, and even the plight of Vaidehi, which so far is either revealed or unrevealed, and whatever legend that has happened, known or unknown in every detail, all that will also be known to you, even if it were to be unknown, as yet...

"You shall versify the heart pleasing and merit yielding legend of Rama, and not a single word of yours will be unfounded in this epic... As long as the mountains and rivers flourish on the surface of the earth, so long the legend of Ramayana will flourish in this world...

"And as long as Rama's legend authored by you flourishes...till then you will be flourishing in heavens, netherworlds, and even in my abode, namely Abode of Brahma..." So said Brahma to Valmiki.

On saying thus that Divinity Brahma vanished then and there only, and then that godly sage Valmiki came by astonishment, along with his disciples. Then all of the disciples of Valmiki very delightedly sang this verse time and again, and they also recited this verse reciprocally in high astonishment.

Equally lettered, four footed is that verse when great Sage Valmiki articulated it, and when repetitively recited by one and all, it attained prominence as verse proper.

Born is an intuition in that great sage and contemplated soul asserting that "I will compose entire Ramayana, the epic, in suchlike verses..."

That celebrated sage and magnanimous seer Valmiki then authored the highly renowned Rama's legend extolling Rama's renown, with symmetrically worded verses, and words versified to yield meanings semantically, prosody free flowing, and with hundreds of such verses.

That epic contains uncomplicated compounds, conjunctions and conjugations, and has expressive sentences that are well knit and led evenly and sweetly, and that legend pertains to the best one from Raghu's dynasty, namely Rama, which also includes the extermination of the Ten headed evil named Ravana, and further, it is said by the sage, hence this may now be listenedâ€¦
